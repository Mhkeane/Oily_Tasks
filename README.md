# Oily_Tasks
A series of basic tasks to help me learn Kotlin.
Taken from a popular probelm site, which I will avoid naming directly. This is as the site asks that solutions are not published. 
I am going to publish my solutions to make my code visible to those looking at my code, but try to avoid references that would make this project appear in search queries. 
I know that there already exist blogs that actively provide answers to the early problems, so I feel that I am not giving anything away.
